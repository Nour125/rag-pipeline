With the recent improvements in diagnosis and treatment of distal radius and carpal injuries, the hand surgeons’ expectations of relevant radiologic interpretation of imaging studies are heightened. Conventional radiographic examinations, as well as more sophisticated and invasive studies, have important roles in the evaluation of wrist fractures and dislocations. On the basis of physical examination results and the mechanism of injury, the onus is on the examining surgeon to pinpoint potential sites of bone or ligament disruption. After this evaluation, appropriate imaging studies appropriately performed and interpreted will help direct treatment and improve outcome with greater clarity and certainty.

While the orthopedic surgeon and the emergency medicine physician initially evaluate injuries of the wrist, which includes the distal radius, distal ulna, carpal bones, and metacarpal bases, it is the radiologist who conﬁrms a clinical suspicion of injury and further characterizes the nature of this injury.

Fractures of the distal radius account for an estimated 17% of fractures seen acutely in the emergency department (1). These injuries occur most commonly among elderly women with osteoporosis, typically because of a fall onto an outstretched hand. Younger patients may also sustain distal radius fractures, often caused by a high-energy mechanism such as a

Both the radiocarpal articulation and the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) must be con- sidered when evaluating fractures of the distal radius. The distal radius has three concave surfaces: the scaphoid and lunate fossae, which articulate with the named carpal bones, and the sigmoid notch, which articulates with the ulna at the DRUJ (Fig 1). The metaphy- seal widening of the distal radius begins approximately 2 cm proximal to the radiocarpal joint. Distal to this broadening, the amount of cortical bone decreases, and the corre-
