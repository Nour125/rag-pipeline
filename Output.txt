Based on medical statistics, it can be concluded that this problem will be intensified. Consumption of food is one of the main activities in human life. What and how one eats affects our health.

Gell and Coombs. The percentage of the immune response was assessed by Chandra as follows: type I – 48%, type II – 6%, type III – 10%, and type IV – 18%. The article pre- sents the risk factors for food allergy, most common symptoms, preventive measures and characteristics of food products that are potential allergens. Key words: food allergy, allergens, food intolerance. In 2001, a new proposal for terminology and the overall classification of allergic diseases (including adverse reactions to foods), taking into account the etiopathogenetic mechanisms, was proposed by the Task Force at the Euro- pean Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). The term “hypersensitivity” is used to describe all the clin- ical response of the body initiated by exposure to allergens of different biological nature (airborne, food and contact) [3]. According to the proposal, the term “food allergy” de - scribes the ingested food-stimulated response in which the immune mechanism is documented or highly likely. All oth- er reactions are determined as “non-allergic food hyper- sensitivity” [4-7]. Consumption of food is one of the main activities in human life. What and how one eats affects our health.

in human life. What and how one eats affects our health. Meals eaten regularly provide the components necessary for the energy metabolism. Multicultural society, travel, and new trends affect the diversity of food consumed. Ingre- dients widely tolerated by the general population may not be well tolerated by some people. This specific situation brings about very serious consequences, sometimes endangering human life [1, 2]. Reactions that may be associated with allergic hyper- sensitivity to food have been reported by doctors of the oldest known civilization. Babylonian Talmud mentions egg white intolerance and suggests treatment options for this condition. Hippocrates observed stomach upset and hives caused by cow’s milk. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the development of resistance and anaphylaxis was understood, which helped create a proper under- standing of the basis of clinical and immunological phe- nomena associated with hypersensitivity-type reactions to foods. Food allergens are proteins whose molecular weight varies from 15 kDa to 40 kDa or glycoproteins having a mol- ecular weight from 10 kDa to 70 kDa, which cause aller- gies in immunologically conditioned, abnormal response of the body.

Many food allergens are capable of binding lig- ands, such as metal ions, lipids and steroids [8, 9]. An impor- tant role in the molecular structure of the allergen is played by epitopes, which are fragments of the antigen, connecting directly to the antibody. They directly interact with the anti- body (namely, the paratope). The epitopes may more or less stimulate the human immune system. The antigen epitopes that generate the strongest immune response in a given species or individual, are called immunodominant deter- minants [10-12]. Currently, the allergen nomenclature subcommittee under the auspices of the International Union of Immuno- logical Societies and the World Health Organization has developed a list of more than 400 allergens and 200 isoal- lergens [13].

allergen nomenclature subcommittee under the auspices of the International Union of Immuno- logical Societies and the World Health Organization has developed a list of more than 400 allergens and 200 isoal- lergens [13]. Allergens derived from a given species can be made up of molecules of a similar structure. These parti- cles, if they have similar biochemical properties, i.e. mol- ecular weight, biological function, and more than 67% amino acid sequence similarity, are called isoallergens [14]. Occurrence of food allergy depends on many factors, including genetic predisposition of an individual, the degree of exposure to food, and molecular characteristics of the allergen [9]. The greatest risk of developing an aller- gy depends on genetic factors. It has been found that the risk of allergy development in children of healthy parents ranges from 5% to 15%, when one of the parents is aller- gic, it increases to 40% and if both parents are sick, reach- es 60-80%. Environmental factors are also important in the development of allergies, such as improved hygiene, lifestyle, diet and nutrition, which are seen as factors respon- sible for the increase in allergic pathology in Western pop- ulations. Breastfeeding, which is the most natural and appropriate form of nutrition for infants, has been replaced with manufactured formulas full of proteins which can impose immunological reaction.

sible for the increase in allergic pathology in Western pop- ulations. Breastfeeding, which is the most natural and appropriate form of nutrition for infants, has been replaced with manufactured formulas full of proteins which can impose immunological reaction. Consumption of canned foods rich in additives and dissemination of new eating habits have contributed to the increase in the number of potential allergens [24]. The mechanism of food allergy reaction covers all 4 types of the immune response of the classical division of Gell and Coombs. The percentage of the immune response was assessed by Chandra as follows: type I – 48%, type II – 6%, type III – 10%, and type IV – 18%. If the harm- ful food triggers the abnormal immune response by type I reaction, the IgE antibodies are involved, and the clinical symptoms occur soon after ingestion of food or within a short period of time (usually about 2 h). This reaction is called immediate (early), and because of the patho- genetic mechanisms – IgE-mediated [15-19]. The IgE anti- bodies play the main role in allergy, and in the healthy human they can be found in small quantities. Only in some people, especially with a hereditary risk of atopy, there is an excessive production of IgE antibodies which trigger aller- gic reactions [20]. The presence of

and in the healthy human they can be found in small quantities. Only in some people, especially with a hereditary risk of atopy, there is an excessive production of IgE antibodies which trigger aller- gic reactions [20]. The presence of IgE antibodies in the pathogenesis of the disease is the main criterion for the definition of food allergy [2]. IgE-dependent allergy in the primary form is especially frequent in children, in which foods are the main or the only cause of the disease or dis- order in contrast to the secondary form, which is more typ- ical of older children and adults, in which foods are one of the many factors causing the disorder. Adverse food-induced immune response can be a sign of other pathogenic mech- anisms of allergic reaction – II, III or IV type when T cells, IgG, IgM, IgA, and other immunologically competent cells are involved. Due to the pathogenic mechanism of these reactions, they are described as IgE-independent [16, 17, 21]. Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the func- tion of cytokines in immunopathology of food allergy. There was a statistically significant increase in IL-10 levels in patients undergoing an oral challenge, and lower levels of IL-10 in the serum of patients having a delayed reaction. In theory, all foods can cause allergic reactions, but

food allergy. There was a statistically significant increase in IL-10 levels in patients undergoing an oral challenge, and lower levels of IL-10 in the serum of patients having a delayed reaction. In theory, all foods can cause allergic reactions, but in reality a small part is responsible for food allergies. Milk, eggs, wheat, fish, soy and peanuts are most often as- sociated with allergic reactions in childhood. In adult humans, allergies to fish, shellfish (lobster, crab, crayfish) and some fruits, especially cherries, peaches, plums, apricots, as well as oleaginous fruits (nuts, seeds) and peanuts are reported [20]. Food traditions of different countries encourage the con- sumption of certain specific products, which if consumed frequently and in large amounts can cause allergic symp- toms. For example, in Italy there are quite frequent cas- es of allergy to certain fruits, raw vegetables, tomatoes and corn. In the countries of northern Europe, the allergy to cod, often consumed in the daily diet, dominates. In the Unit- ed States, high consumption of peanuts is responsible for an increasing number of extremely rapid allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock [24]. Allergens may be divided into two groups: resistant and non-resistant to heat. The former group of allergens is linked to the order of amino acids in the protein segment. This group includes peanut allergens, cod, milk

including anaphylactic shock [24]. Allergens may be divided into two groups: resistant and non-resistant to heat. The former group of allergens is linked to the order of amino acids in the protein segment. This group includes peanut allergens, cod, milk lactoglobulin, egg white ovalbumin, all of which are resistant to heat and act even after cooking the product. The latter group is asso- ciated with the spatial structure of the protein. The impact of high temperature causes changes in the three- dimensional structure of the protein, these allergens, pre- dominantly fruits, vegetables or meat, often lose their sen- Postępy Dermatologii i Alergologii XXX; 2013/2 114 [PAGE 3] accompanied by symptoms occurring within a few min- utes, or even seconds after consumption of the food, which is anaphylaxis (shock), urticaria, angioneurotic edema (skin swelling). Eggs, nuts, peanuts, fish and shellfish are often foods that often cause this type of allergy. The second type of food allergy is a late reaction, in which the symptoms (fatigue, irritability, depression, hyperactivity, insomnia, headache, poor concentration, paleness, itching limbs, invol- untary bedwetting, asthma, colds, indigestion, colic, diar- rhea, bloating and skin lesions) appear a few hours, and even a few days after food intake. Foods that cause this type of reaction are milk, chocolate, legumes, citrus and food additives. Because of this delay, it is

Foods that cause this type of reaction are milk, chocolate, legumes, citrus and food additives. Because of this delay, it is difficult to deter- mine what is the cause of food allergies [27]. sitization by boiling, while they are still active in raw fruits and vegetables [24]. In 1995, experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) compiled a list consisting of eight groups of foods that cause most food allergies. A number of clinical experience from Europe and North America suggest that these eight groups of foodstuffs are responsible for about 90% of all food allergies. The main causes of protein allergies are milk, eggs, peanuts, other nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, cereals, sen- sitizing at different frequencies [24]. According to the law, in the European Union, ready meals may contain a mix- ture of different known allergens without having to show data on the individual components of the package. “25 per- cent rule” states that the components of the product must be listed separately only if their share exceeds 25%. According to the Act, the ingredients of a food product and not the individual substances in the ingredients must be shown [25]. According to

that the components of the product must be listed separately only if their share exceeds 25%. According to the Act, the ingredients of a food product and not the individual substances in the ingredients must be shown [25]. According to the literature, food allergies may increase as a result of the use of genetically modified products [24, 26]. In the research of Brazil nut gene insertion to soy- bean genetic material, allergies in patients who are aller- gic to these nuts were reported. Manipulating the com- position of plant proteins without the knowledge of their allergenic potential can be very dangerous. However, not every genetic modification may have negative effects. In the U.S.A., for example, major work was carried out on removing allergens from peanuts to get the nut free of aller- gens [27]. In the case of food intolerance, many of the same symp- toms as allergic reactions persist but have other causes. Enzyme deficiency is responsible for the lack of tolerance causing certain food ingredients not to be degraded. The enzymatic defect can be either congenital or acquired in the course of life. For example, due to the lack of enzymes, some people do not digest milk sugar (lactose). In other cases, an ingredient of a food product acts like an allergen. The symptoms are the same as

in the course of life. For example, due to the lack of enzymes, some people do not digest milk sugar (lactose). In other cases, an ingredient of a food product acts like an allergen. The symptoms are the same as in the allergic response, including excessive histamine production leading to a runny nose, watery eyes and swollen lips, but the immune system is not involved, and the reaction is evoked direct- ly by a component of a food product. The factors that cause the reaction are colorants (E 102, E 107, E 110, E 122, E 123, E 124, E 128, E 151), preservatives (E 210, E 219, E 200, E 203), substances enhancing taste and flavor (E 620, E 625, E 626, E 629, E 630, E 633), flavors (salt of cinnamic acid, vanillin, eugenol, menthol) and synthetic antioxidants (E 311, E 320, E 321) added to many food products [25]. An important role among the causes of hypersensitivity reaction is played by sulfur dioxide, which can be found in various species of wine, dried fruits and pickles. Tyra- mine and histamine (biogenic amines) contained in some foods (histamine in strawberries, tomatoes, some kinds of cheese, and tyramine in cheese, wine, nuts) may also be responsible for the symptoms [29]. Food allergy can manifest a wide range of symptoms.

mine and histamine (biogenic amines) contained in some foods (histamine in strawberries, tomatoes, some kinds of cheese, and tyramine in cheese, wine, nuts) may also be responsible for the symptoms [29]. Food allergy can manifest a wide range of symptoms. No other disease known in the medical world has a greater variety of symptoms that may persist even after the res- olution of the major allergy attack [28]. The appearance of itching of the lips or tongue, repeated vomiting, frequent diarrhea or urticaria may be defined as the most common symptoms, which reveal an allergic reaction to food. Refusal of certain foods by some children may indicate an allergy or intolerance and not a whim, especially when com- bined with a particular problem [24]. Fatigue caused by aller- gies can be felt the most in the morning and right after get- ting out of bed, or late in the afternoon, when any kind of rest or its length does not bring relief. Pain, stiffness and muscle tearing of the shoulder, neck and back, which may occur with headache, may drag through the days and weeks. Psychiatric disorders (tension, nervousness, irri- tability, stubbornness, anxiety, confusion, nervousness com- bined with trembling, stammering, disorderly speech, lethar- gy, stupor, aphasia – loss of the ability to speak, and feeling dazed, depression, discouragement, melancholy) are

Psychiatric disorders (tension, nervousness, irri- tability, stubbornness, anxiety, confusion, nervousness com- bined with trembling, stammering, disorderly speech, lethar- gy, stupor, aphasia – loss of the ability to speak, and feeling dazed, depression, discouragement, melancholy) are com- mon in allergic individuals [28]. Generally, there are two types of food allergy. The first type is characterized by immediate reaction, which is The basic principle of food allergy treatment is to avoid these food ingredients that cause allergic reactions. This requires a careful selection of products for the meal, which involves the obligation to read the composition of the prod- ucts given on the labels. The most recent legislation on food labeling is aware of the needs of allergic people. An impor- tant step is the list of the most important allergens and ingredients derived from them, given in the directive of the European Union. Sometimes, however, typical symptoms of allergy occurs to hidden allergens – components nat- Postępy Dermatologii i Alergologii XXX; 2013/2 115 [PAGE 4] Wioletta Agnieszka Żukiewicz-Sobczak, Paula Wróblewska, Piotr Adamczuk, Przemysław Kopczyński urally present in the food or added to it in the form of a mul- ti-product, whose name appears on the label as opposed to its specific composition [30].

in the food or added to it in the form of a mul- ti-product, whose name appears on the label as opposed to its specific composition [30]. One allergen may be present in many foods and many allergens can be found in one food product. Allergenic prop- erties may have both components naturally occurring in foods and added ones. Monosodium glutamate (additive E 621) has the same allergenic properties as monosodium glutamate found in many foods naturally, such as toma- toes, mushrooms, corn, peas, parmesan, in hydrolysates of vegetable proteins, yeast extracts, caseinates. Symptoms of allergies to monosodium glutamate depend on the size of the dose. Therefore, in order not to restrict the con- sumption of the products, in which sodium glutamate is naturally present, products that contain it as additive E 621 must be eliminated from the diet [30]. The increase in the incidence of the disease, which underlies the phenomena associated with allergic hyper- sensitivity to food, and the progress of knowledge in new fields such as immunology, molecular biology and genet- ics over the last several years led to an unprecedented increase in interest in the difficult field of allergy. It is to be hoped, therefore, that this knowledge in subsequent years will be further expanded [31, 32]. 14. Dobek R, Obojski A. Alergeny inhalacyjne. http://www.gor- nicki.pl/uplo

The 'count' row indicates the number of observations for each variable, which is 1348 for all four. The 'mean' row shows the average value for each variable: the mean age is 39.228487, the mean BMI is 30.655499, the mean number of children is 1.103858, and the mean charge is 13254.716622.

image is a stacked bar chart that displays the distribution of individuals across different Body Mass Index (BMI) categories, grouped by their "charges" on a horizontal axis. The vertical axis, labeled "Count," indicates the number of individuals in each category. The chart contains five distinct BMI categories, as indicated by the legend on the right: "normal weight" (blue), "obese" (orange), "overweight" (green), and "underweight" (red). The "underweight" category is represented by the red bars, which are the smallest in all stacks. The "normal weight" category is represented by the blue bars, which are the largest in each stack. The "obese" category is represented by the orange bars, and the "overweight" category is represented by the green bars. The horizontal axis, labeled "charges," is scaled from 0 to 60,000, with major tick marks at intervals of 10,000. Each bar on the chart is composed of stacked segments, with the height of each segment corresponding to the count of individuals in that specific BMI category for a given charge level. For example, the first bar, which corresponds to a charge level of approximately 0, is composed of a small red segment (underweight), a green segment (overweight), an orange segment (obese), and a large blue segment (normal weight). The blue segment is the highest, indicating that the largest number of individuals in this

The blue segment is the highest, indicating that the largest number of individuals in this charge group are of normal weight. The red segment is the smallest, indicating the fewest individuals are underweight. The chart shows a clear trend: the number of individuals in the "normal weight" category is highest for the lowest charge levels, while the number of individuals in the "obese" category is highest for the highest charge levels. The "underweight" and "overweight" categories are present at all charge levels, but their counts are generally smaller than those of the "normal weight" and "obese" categories. The image does not convey any information about food allergies. The chart is solely focused on the distribution of BMI categories by charge level, and there is no visual or textual information in the image that relates to food allergies or any related health conditions.] Figure 3: Histogram of the charges feature using binning that the histogram is multimodal, albeit that the right ”peak” is only slight, so an argument could also be made for ”unimodal, skewed to the left”.

For instance, obese patients are responsible for nearly all charges over 40000 dollars. Similarly, patients with normal BMI tend to have relatively low charges. (h) The scatterplot of smokers can be seen in figure 4. ”Report one interesting finding for the relation between charges and the other features considering the smoker feature.”: Interest- ingly, the plot comparing charges and BMI reveals that, unlike one is left to assume after seeing how obese people are nearly solely responsible for charges over 40000 dollars, obesity alone for non-smokers rarely leads to such costs. It is only the combination of people being obese and smokers that leads to most of these high charges.

This can imply that older people tend to have a higher total medical charge, and people with a higher total medical charge tend to be older.

If most points were close to the next higher border or whisker, the mean could still be higher than the median, and if most points were close to the next lower border or whisker, the mean could as well be lower than the median. ”Is the lower 1st quartile fence of smokers lower than the upper whisker of the non-smokers?”: Yes. The lower first quartile fence is not larger than the lower whisker of smokers. This whisker is clearly below 20000, while the upper whisker of non-smokers is clearly above 20000, thus higher. We constructed a baseline classifier called the wishfulThinking model, which always predicts the class ”low”, independent of the input features. This model completely ignores the data and serves as a trivial baseline for comparison. To evaluate its performance, we applied it to the test set and computed the accuracy by comparing the constant predictions to the true chargeGroup labels.

The resulting accuracy reflects the proportion of “low” instances in the test data. Accuracy of wishfulThinking model: 0.49 We implemented a modeBased model, which always predicts the most frequent class (mode) of the chargeGroup feature in the training dataset. After computing the mode, we used it as a constant prediction for every instance in the test set. We then evaluated the model using accuracy. Mode of chargeGroup in the training dataset: • The most frequent class in the training data is medium. The modeBased model performs worse than the wishfulThinking model. This occurs because the mode of the training data does not match the most common class in the test data. Consequently, always predicting the training-set mode leads to systematically incorrect predictions on the test set. In contrast, the wishfulThinking model always predicts low, which aligns better with the class distribution of the test data, resulting in a higher accuracy. We trained a series of decision tree classifiers with maximum depths ranging from 1 to 9.

Prior to training, we removed the non- descriptive features id, charges, and chargeGroup to ensure that only relevant predictors were used. For each tree depth, we evaluated the accuracy on the test dataset. The resulting accuracy curve is shown in Figure 6. The accuracy increases substantially from depth 1 to depth 4, after which it plateaus. The highest accuracy achieved was 0.94 at a maximum depth of 4. All deeper depths (5 to 9) produce identical accuracies. [PAGE 5] [IMAGE: This image is a line chart with the title "Accuracy vs Tree Depth".

A single line, composed of blue circular data points connected by straight lines, traces the trend. The line begins at a point corresponding to Tree Depth 1 and Accuracy 0.750. As Tree Depth increases from 1 to 3, the Accuracy increases sharply, rising from 0.750 to approximately 0.925. The line then becomes relatively flat, with Accuracy stabilizing at approximately 0.940 from Tree Depth 4 to 9. The line remains at this plateau for the entire range of tree depths shown. The chart visually represents the performance of a machine learning model, likely a decision tree, as its depth increases. The data suggests that the model's accuracy improves with depth up to a certain point, after which it plateaus, indicating that further increases in depth do not improve accuracy. This is a common observation in machine learning, where deeper trees can overfit the training data, leading to diminishing returns in performance.

This plateau occurs because additional splits beyond depth 4 either violate the constraint min samples leaf = 6 or do not decrease the entropy sufficiently to warrant a split. As a con- sequence, the effective tree structure does not grow further even when a larger maximum depth is allowed. Based on these observations, we select a maximum depth of 4 as it provides the best predictive performance without introducing unnecessary complexity. We trained a decision tree classifier to predict the chargeGroup feature using the same descriptive variables from the one-hot encoded dataset as before. The model was configured with the Gini impurity (criterion = gini), a minimum leaf size of six samples, a maximum depth of two, and a fixed random seed. The resulting tree structure is shown in Figure 7. From the visualization, we can identify the conditions that lead to a prediction of the medium charge group. Since the tree has a maximum depth of two, only two splits determine the classifi- cation paths.

The leaf node predicting medium is reached when the following conditions hold: • The patient is at most 44.5 years old (age ≤44.5), • and the patient is a non-smoker, i.e. smoker yes = 0. Thus, individuals who are younger than approximately 45 years and do not smoke are assigned to the low charge group by this tree. No additional conditions are evaluated because the maximum depth restricts the tree to only two decision levels. We also applied the trained model to a specific example: a 42-year-old male with a BMI of 36, two children, who does not smoke and lives in the northwest region. After constructing the corresponding one-hot encoded feature vector and evaluating it with the decision tree, the predicted charge group was: chargeGroup = low.

The points show a general upward trend, indicating that as age increases, the “charges” tend to increase, though with significant variability around the trend.

(a) Charges over age. We visualized the relationship between age and charges on the training set using seaborn.lmplot, including the fitted linear regression line (see Figure 9). The plot and the linear regression line both show a slight positive trend: on average, higher age is associated with higher charges. However, the points are widely scattered and form several bands, indicating that age alone cannot explain most of the variance in medical costs. Hence, a simple linear regression on age only is not a particularly good fit for this data. (b) Linear regression model for charges.

The mean absolute error (MAE) on the test data was 4306.85. This error indicates that, on average, the predicted charges deviate from the true charges by about $4300, which reflects the substantial variability and complexity of the underlying cost structure that cannot be fully captured by a linear model.

Note, that these steps where already completed in the provided Jupyter file. Afterwards, the columns of features charges and chargeGroup are removed from the training and test data set. Finally, the target vectors for training and test data are created. For SVM (1), we use the descriptive features age and bmi as described in the task and the de- scriptive feature smoker in the form of both smoker_yes and smoker_no that are features in the one-hot-encoded data sets. We decided to use both of the one-hot encoded features of the original feature smoker because it fits the task description the most and does not have a noticeable impact on model performance. For SVM (2), we use all descriptive features expect for the once excluded in the task description. Regarding the origin features that are encoded in multiple features, we decided to use all of them for the same reasons as before. For both SVM (1) and (2), we created a new SVM each using SVC of sklearn.svm with regular- ization parameter C = 10 and kernel="linear" since the task calls for linear SVM classifiers. The SVMs are then trained using the training data constrained to the respective descriptive features as described before. For training, we use the method fit().

for linear SVM classifiers. The SVMs are then trained using the training data constrained to the respective descriptive features as described before. For training, we use the method fit(). Now that SVMs (1) and (2) are trained, predictions of the target features are created based on test data constrained to the descriptive features of SVM (1) and (2) respectively. This is done using the predict() method. Using confusion_matrix of sklearn.metrics, we compute the confusion matrices for the prediction of SVM (1) and (2). Find these in table 1. A detailed explanation follows in subtask (b). The confusion matrices in table 1 created for subtask (a) will now be discussed. The first thing we notice it, that both matrices are exactly equal despite differences in the descriptive features used to train SVM (1) and SVM (2). Because SVM (1) achieves the same prediction quality as SVM (2), we assume that the descriptive features age, bmi, and smoker (in the form of the one- hot-encoding discussed in subtask (a)) are as a whole or in parts sufficient to predict whether a charge is expensive. This assumption is supported when looking at the descriptive feature smoker and the corresponding distribution of target features. smoker alone already allows for a prediction close to the predictions of SVM (1) and (2). Note, that we only

is expensive. This assumption is supported when looking at the descriptive feature smoker and the corresponding distribution of target features. smoker alone already allows for a prediction close to the predictions of SVM (1) and (2). Note, that we only looked at the raw data for this result and counted using the basic document search function and did not train further SVMs on different descriptive features. The other descriptive features age and bmi do not allow such an easy observation by eye. This provides an explanation for the behaviour of the SVMs regardless and thus fits our expectations even though an intuitive expectation might assume better behaviour of SVM (2) as it uses more descriptive features. The accuracy and precision of both SVM (1) and (2) are equal as the confusion matrices are equal. The accuracy of both models is 36+220 36+220+3+9 ≈0.96. This indicates that the over-all quality of our SVMs is high. The precision of both SVMs is 36 36+3 ≈0.92. This precision still indicates a good classification quality, but also shows where our models might perform slightly worse. The models generally [PAGE 10] Table 2: Confusion matrices for SVMs with normalized data and the same descriptive features as SVM (1) and SVM (2). make comparatively more mistakes classifying as expensive compared to the overall correctness of classification.

worse. The models generally [PAGE 10] Table 2: Confusion matrices for SVMs with normalized data and the same descriptive features as SVM (1) and SVM (2). make comparatively more mistakes classifying as expensive compared to the overall correctness of classification. We use the StandardScaler() of sklearn.preprocessing with default parameters for normal- ization. To this end, the entire training data is first fitted to the scaler using fit(). Then, we normalize the entire training and test data using transform(). We also recreate the previous structure of the data by adding the column names anew using pandas.DataFrame(). Note, that we do not normalize the target feature as our SVMs are binary classifiers. Now, we follow the same steps as in subtask (a) to train and test SVMs on the descriptive features of SVMs (1) and (2) using the normalized data sets. In this way, we get the confusion matrices in table 2. When comparing the SVMs using descriptive features of SVM (1) with and without normalized data sets, we see that the confusion matrices are equal once more. The reason for this is likely that the descriptive features bmi and age have a somewhat similar value range and that smoker is binary. The SVM with the descriptive features of SVM (2) and normalization behaves minutely better than SVM (2). A single false

is likely that the descriptive features bmi and age have a somewhat similar value range and that smoker is binary. The SVM with the descriptive features of SVM (2) and normalization behaves minutely better than SVM (2). A single false positive less occurs with normalization increasing the amount of true negatives by one. Otherwise, the confusion matrices of these SVMs are also the same. This behaviour has likely similar reasons as previously. The only feature that has a slightly different range and is not binary is children. Because the range of children is not drastically different from the other parameters, normalization likely only leads to the minute improvement. The training and testing for SVMs (1) and (2) takes 0.1s and 0.2s respectively. Using scaling prior to training with the same descriptive features reduces this time such that the jupyter notebook indicates 0.0s as computation time. This decrease likely results from a fitting process with scaled data that can be performed faster. To investigate the impact of decreasing the regular- ization parameter C, we performed training and test- ing as described in subtask (a) for the values of C in the first column of 3. We used accuracy_score() of sklearn.metrics to compute the accuracy of both SVM (1) and (2) with the different regularization parameters as depicted in the second and

in subtask (a) for the values of C in the first column of 3. We used accuracy_score() of sklearn.metrics to compute the accuracy of both SVM (1) and (2) with the different regularization parameters as depicted in the second and third column of the same table. No changes of accuracy (with the given precision) oc- cur until C = 0.50 for SVM (2). Then, we notice a local minimum between C = 0.50 and C = 0.10. This minimum is not reflected in SVM (1). Therefore, the de- creased accuracy is likely caused by the increased amount of descriptive features. Based on the data, we assume that the descriptive feature relevant for correct classifi- cation of the test data are disregarded to a higher degree which is permissible due to the lower value and by chance optimal. 10.00 0.96 0.96 7.50 0.96 0.96 5.00 0.96 0.96 2.50 0.96 0.96 1.00 0.96 0.96 0.75 0.96 0.96 0.50 0.96 0.95 0.25 0.95 0.94 0.10 0.96 0.95 0.05 0.95 0.96 0.03 0.94 0.96 0.01 0.86 0.87 Table 3: Accuracy of SVM (1) and (2) for decreasing regularization param- eters C.

For SVM (1), the accuracy of the model begins to decrease starting at C = 0.05. Before a similar trend can be noticed for SVM (2), the accuracy first goes up to the value of C = 10 for C ∈{0.03, 0.05}. We attribute this behaviour to the specific instances in test and training data. This decrease in performance for low enough regularization parameters is expected. The trade- off between classification quality and punishment for errors with small values of C at some point disregards the error to a high enough decree that relevant instances are ingnored This is the case starting around C = 0.05 for SVM (1) and around C = 0.01 for SVM (2). Normalization of data changes the relative scale of different features such that their values are comparable across features. For our data, that initially consists of features with similar scale, normalization does not have a significant impact on accuracy. For data with significantly varying scales of different features, normalization might affect accuracy to a higher degree as otherwise some features might have a way to strong/weak impact simply due to their scale.

For data with significantly varying scales of different features, normalization might affect accuracy to a higher degree as otherwise some features might have a way to strong/weak impact simply due to their scale. Before the start of any subtask, the data is prepared. To that end, the one-hot-encoded training and test data sets are loaded. Then, the descriptive features and the target vectors for training and test data are extracted. We first define the MLP using MLPClassifier() specifying five hidden layers with five neurons each and logistic as activation function. We restrict the number of iterations to 2000. Then, we train the MLP on the training data and make a prediction for the target feature of the test data. fit is used to train the MLP and perdict for the prediction. Afterwards, we use accuracy_score of sklearn.metrics to compute an accuracy of 0.39 for our prediction. Similarly, we get the confusion matrix for the prediction depicted in table 4 using confusion_matrix of sklearn.metrics. The accuracy indicates a low rate of correct classification. A reason for this is found in the confusion matrix. The MLP always predicts medium seemingly regardless of input. Note, that the execution of our code is not determin- istic. The resulting accuracy and confusion matrix may vary. We attribute this

reason for this is found in the confusion matrix. The MLP always predicts medium seemingly regardless of input. Note, that the execution of our code is not determin- istic. The resulting accuracy and confusion matrix may vary. We attribute this behaviour to the random initial- ization of weights during training. We decided to use this specific accuracy and confusion matrix as it seems to fit the overall goal of this task. Other initializations can by chance result in significantly better performance (higher accuracy). We further investigate our MLP using probability es- timates for the test data. To this end, we compute the mean and variance of these estimates for the predictions low, medium, and high. These values are depicted in table 5. We see that on average the MLP predicts medium with a low amount of confidence. This result fits to the confusion matrix in table 4. Especially, because the variance for all three classes is 0.00. This would once again indicate the behaviour that medium is always predicted seen in the confusion matrix. The probability estimates for the first five instances depicted in table 6 also shows this.

In this task, we are asked to improve the MLP created in subtask (a) by potentially preprocessing the data and by changing the MLP. To this end, we tested the effect of preprocessing on this specific data set. Normalization of the data using StandardScaler() of sklearn.preprocessing did not seem to improve the accuracy. This behaviour fits with the results seen in task 5. Similarly, the restriction to fewer descriptive features did not lead to an improvement of the MLP. Thus, we decided not use any preprocessing on the data. On the other hand, we did modify the parameters of the MLP. We did not change the amount of hidden layers, but did vary the number of neurons in them. The first hidden layer now has 15 neurons, the second 7, the third 16, the fourth 8, and the last hidden layer 16. We arrive at these numbers

of hidden layers, but did vary the number of neurons in them. The first hidden layer now has 15 neurons, the second 7, the third 16, the fourth 8, and the last hidden layer 16. We arrive at these numbers by iteratively changing them and checking the performance based on accuracy. We also change the activation function used in all layers to relu as this leads to an immediate increase in accuracy. The final change to the MLP is an increase of the number of iterations from 2000 to 10000. It is straight forward that more training time should result in a better MLP. These adjustments result in an accuracy of 0.94 and the confusion matrix depicted in table 7. Note, that this MLP has the non-deterministic be- haviour mentioned for subtask (a). We chose this par- ticular result, as it shows that our changes lead to an improvement of the accuracy compared to the MLP in subtask (a). During our tests, we did not find that this MLP performs worse than the worst case performance of the MLP from the previous subtask. It is however possi- ble when training both MLP often enough that the MLP in the previous subtasks performs better than the current one.

This only happens for bad instantiations of this MLP and very good instantiations of the previous one. We also did not find that the MLP in subtask (a) can perform better than the best performance of the MLP in this subtask. We first train a naive Bayesian classifier on the unscaled training data using fit(). We than predict the target feature for the test data using predict() and compute the accuracy using accuracy_score(). This results in an accuracy of 0.62 and the confusion matrix depicted in table 8. Based on the confusion matrix, this model seems to struggle with the differentiation of low and medium as well as medium and high. After normalizing the training and test data using StandardScaler(), we train a naive Bayesian classifier on the scaled data. For this model the accuracy is 0.39, and we get the confusion matrix depicted in table 9. Based on the confusion matrix, this classifier always predicts medium. We thus see a similar problem to the classifier without normalization of data. The likely reason for the decreased performance of this second model is the reduced difference between descriptive features after normalization. Table 8: Confusion

Food allergy is a growing concern, and recognition of symptoms, knowledge of common food allergens, and management of reactions are important for patients and practitioners.

of a classic IgE- mediated food allergy vary in severity and can include any combination of laryngeal edema, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urticaria, angioedema, and hypotension. Many foods can induce an allergic reaction, but the most commonly implicated foods include cow’s milk, egg, peanut, tree nut, soy, wheat, ﬁsh, and shellﬁsh. Milk and egg allergy generally develop and are outgrown in childhood. Peanut and tree nut allergy can occur during childhood or adulthood, are less likely to be outgrown, and tend to cause more fatal reactions. Given the possibility of life-threatening reactions, it is important to recognize the potential for cross-reactivity among food groups. Diagnosis of food allergy includes skin prick testing, speciﬁc serum IgE testing, and oral food challenges. Management is centered on avoidance of allergenic and cross-reacting foods and early recognition and immediate treatment of reactions. Treatment protocols to desensitize patients to food are currently under investigation. ª 2015 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research n Mayo Clin Proc. 2015;90(10):1411-1419 although an accurate prediction of prevalence is difﬁcult given the imprecise diagnoses of food al- lergy.2 A systematic review reported that food al- lergy affects between 2% and 10% of the population.3 According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ood allergy is a public health concern that canimpairqualityoflifeandhasthepoten- tial to induce life-threatening reactions.

Symptoms may involve the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and/or cardiovascular system. Respiratory symptoms include sneezing, congestion, rhinorrhea, wheezing, and laryngeal edema. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diar- rhea. Cutaneous ﬁndings include urticaria, angioedema, ﬂushing, or pruritus. Cardiovas- cular ﬁndings include tachycardia, hypoten- sion, or syncope. Symptoms are usually seen within minutes of ingesting a food but may not appear for up to 2 hours and can vary in severity from pruritus alone to anaphylactic shock.1 Risk Factors Atopic dermatitis, a family history of atopy, and asthma

Numerous other factors including vitamin D deﬁciency and obesity have been associated with food allergy, although these factors need further exploration. Early Exposure Can Be PreventivedLessons From a Peanut Allergy Population In the past, it had been generally recommended that children avoid allergenic foods to reduce the likelihood of development of allergies. However, in a recent study, high-risk infants (those with atopic dermatitis, egg allergy, or both) were randomized to ingest or avoid peanut products from 4 to 11 months of age (depending on age at enrollment) until 5 years of age. The investigators found that high-risk children who regularly consumed peanut protein (in the form of peanut butter or peanut-ﬂavored snacks) were far less likely (70%-86% reduction) to have development of a peanut allergy.6 This marked reduction in development of allergy may impact new food allergy guidelines

who regularly consumed peanut protein (in the form of peanut butter or peanut-ﬂavored snacks) were far less likely (70%-86% reduction) to have development of a peanut allergy.6 This marked reduction in development of allergy may impact new food allergy guidelines in the near future. Food allergy and food intolerances are different diagnoses and are commonly confused by patients.Inchildhood,intolerance syndromes, such as food proteineinduced enterocolitis syn- drome, can be severe and cause hypotension due to third spacing. Food proteineinduced enterocolitis syndrome is triggered by milk, soy, oat, rice, and rarely meat and manifests with emesis, diarrhea, and lethargy.1 Food proteine induced enteropathy presents as a milder reaction with diarrhea and less commonly with vomiting.11 Food proteineinduced allergic proctocolitis is a benign condition manifesting as bloody stools in well-appearing infants and is usually caused by milk or soy passed through breast milk or contained in formula.11 Common Food Allergens and Natural History Although 170 foods have been identiﬁed as aller- genic, only a small number of these foods are responsible for a majority of reactions.1 Cow’s milk, egg, peanut, tree nut, soy, wheat, ﬁsh, and shellﬁsh are the most commonly allergenic foods. Allergy to egg, milk, soy, and wheat tends to occur most commonly during childhood (before 1-2 years of age),7 while ﬁsh, peanut, and tree nut allergies can occur during any

wheat, ﬁsh, and shellﬁsh are the most commonly allergenic foods. Allergy to egg, milk, soy, and wheat tends to occur most commonly during childhood (before 1-2 years of age),7 while ﬁsh, peanut, and tree nut allergies can occur during any phase of life. In general, children are more likely to outgrow a wheat, soy, milk, and egg allergy and are less likely to outgrow peanut, tree nut, ﬁsh, or shellﬁsh allergy.8 Certain foods are more likely to produce a more severe reaction than others. In studies of food allergy fatalities, over 90% of In adults, food intolerance usually presents with gastrointestinal symptoms including bloat- ing, ﬂatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or nausea and generally does not cause life- threatening reactions. Symptoms of a food allergy occur reliably and reproducibly with exposure to a speciﬁc food, which is not always the case with food intolerances in adults. Food intolerances can include lactose intolerance, fructose intolerance, or irritable bowel syndrome that may or may not be asso- ciated with certain foods.

However, this testing is often pursued in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis to identify a subset of patients who have concurrent IgE-mediated food allergy.12 This article focuses on classic food al- lergy. Other immunologic and nonimmuno- logic reactions to food (many discussed in the preceding sections) are summarized in the Table. Cow’s Milk Cow’s milk allergy is the most common food allergy. Its prevalence is higher in children (prev- alence of 2.64% in the NHANES population) Mayo Clin Proc. n October 2015;90(10):1411-1419 n http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2015.07.012 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org 1413 [PAGE 4] and therefore, patients with reactions to cow’s milk should also avoid goat’s milk and sheep’s milk.8 Clinical cross-reactivity between cow’s milk and beef is 10%, and cooking beef further decreases its allergenicity; therefore, avoiding beef is generally not recommended in patients with a milk allergy14 (Figure). If allergic to: Risk of reaction to at least one: Risk of cross reactivity Egg Egg allergy also tends to occur in childhood, and most children outgrow egg allergy by late child- hood.15 The prevalence of egg allergy in the NHANES population was 0.65% in children and 0.51% in adults.4 A retrospective study found resolution of egg allergy in 4% of children by age 4 years, 12% by 6 years, 37% by 10 years, and 68% by 16 years.

Patients who did not have resolution of their allergy had higher egg-speciﬁc IgE levels.15 Inﬂuenza Vaccination and Egg Allergy Egg allergy has generated considerable interest because of concern regarding the safety of the inﬂuenza vaccine in patients with this allergy. The inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine and the live attenuated vaccines are produced by growing the inﬂuenza virus in chicken eggs, and there- fore, these vaccines contain small quantities of ovalbumin. Many studies have found that these vaccines can be safely given to egg-allergic indi- viduals including those with severe allergic reac- tions such as anaphylaxis.16 Egg-allergic patients may receive the vaccine as a single dose or a 2-step challenge (10% of the dose followed by 90% of the dose), but these individuals should be monitored for 30 minutes after vaccination.17 FIGURE.

Therefore, egg allergy, even in those with egg-induced anaphylaxis, may not be a contrain- dication to receiving the inﬂuenza vaccine.

For example, dry roasting of peanuts can increase the allergenicity of peanuts by strengthening bonds and forming new In a study by Wood et al,13 children with milk allergy with an IgE level of less than 2 kU/L had a 5.74-fold higher likelihood of tolerating milk at 66 months compared with children with a level of 10 kU/L.

Some proteins in egg and milk lose their allergenicity when cooked.18 Most patients with egg and milk allergy will tolerate the baked forms of these foods. In one study, 75% of milk-allergic children tolerated prod- ucts with heated milk.19 In another study performed in Australia, 80% of egg-allergic patients tolerated baked egg.20 age 1 year had resolution of their allergy by age 4 years.23 Legumes (which include peanut and soy) have a high rate of cross-sensitization on testing, but clinical cross-reactions between foods in the legume family occur infrequently.14 From limited data from double-blind, placebo- controlled trials, the rate of clinical reactivity to another food within the legume family is 5% (Figure).

the rate of clinical reactivity to another food within the legume family is 5% (Figure). Tree Nuts Tree nuts include but are not limited to walnut, almond, hazelnut, cashew, pecan, pistachio, and Brazil nut. Tree nut allergy may develop in adulthood or childhood. The prevalence in child- hood is 0.52%, and the prevalence in adulthood is 0.87%.4 As with peanuts, tree nuts can also lead to fatal reactions. In a study assessing food allergy fatalities, 31% of fatal reactions were attributed to tree nuts.9,10 Another important point with tree nuts is the potential for cross- reactivity. Cross-reactivity between tree nuts has been reported at 37%, although comprehensive studies have not been performed given the poten- tially fatal and relatively frequent reactions to tree nuts.14 Baked egg and milk may tolerize the im- mune system to these foods and can have an effect comparable to immunotherapy. In one study, children eating baked egg products regu- larly were 14.6 times more likely to be tolerant to regular egg and achieved tolerance sooner (50 months vs 78.7 months) than patients not ingesting baked egg.21 Similarly, in a study eval- uating baked cow’s milk, patients who regularly ingested baked milk were 16 times more likely to become tolerant to unheated milk than patients who were not consuming baked milk.22 If patients have already incorporated

If not, an oral food challenge with the baked food should be performed before con- sumption of the unbaked product.8 Incorpora- tion of baked products not only hastens tolerance to regular milk and egg but also improves quality of life in these patients and therefore should be considered for egg- and milk-allergic patients. Peanut and Tree Nut Cross-Reactivity The rate of clinical reactivity between peanuts and tree nuts is unknown but is reported to be between 23% and 50% in atopic patients and is likely lower in the general population.14 Given the severity of reactions that can occur with tree nuts and peanuts and misidentiﬁcation between these foods, avoidance of all tree nuts and pea- nuts should be considered in allergic patients, especially children. Peanut (Legumes) Peanut allergy is of particular concern given that it leads to fatal reactions more commonly than other foods.9,10 In a study evaluating fatal food reactions, 62.5% of fatalities were thought to be due to peanut.9,10 Peanut allergy

Peanut (Legumes) Peanut allergy is of particular concern given that it leads to fatal reactions more commonly than other foods.9,10 In a study evaluating fatal food reactions, 62.5% of fatalities were thought to be due to peanut.9,10 Peanut allergy can develop in adulthood or childhood and is not as likely to be outgrown. A recent prospective study found that a lower peanut-speciﬁc IgE level and a smaller wheal size on peanut SPT predicted a higher rate of resolution of peanut allergy.23 In this study, an SPT threshold of 8 mm or a peanut-speciﬁc IgE level of 2.1 kU/L or greater at age 4 years had a 95% positive predictive value for persistent peanut allergy.23 Only 22% of children with a peanut allergy diagnosed at Shellﬁsh Shellﬁsh allergy has a prevalence of 0.87% in children and 2.04% in adults. Shellﬁsh allergy commonly develops during adulthood. There is no established relationship between iodine allergy or radiocontrast reactions with shellﬁsh or ﬁsh allergy.8 Clinical cross-reactivity between shellﬁsh is 75%.14 Tropomyosin is the identiﬁed allergen and has a high rate of conserving its sequence among different crustaceans including shrimp, crab, and lobster; mollusks including oyster, scallop, and squid; and insects such as cockroach, grasshopper, and dust mite.14 Given the severity of shellﬁsh reactions and cross- reactivity between shellﬁsh, all shellﬁsh should Mayo Clin

Systemic symptoms such as urticaria, asthma, or anaphylaxis are rare but can occur. In one study, 8.7% of patients with oral allergy syndrome had systemic symptoms.25 These cross-reactive proteins are generally heat labile, and therefore, symptoms seen with ingestion of the raw food do not occur when the food has been cooked or processed. be avoided unless a challenge can prove tolerance. Fish As with shellﬁsh, ﬁsh allergy can develop in adulthood. Clinical cross-reactivity between ﬁsh is 50%24; therefore, all ﬁsh should be avoided unless an oral challenge conﬁrms tolerance to speciﬁc ﬁsh. Most patients with ﬁsh allergy are able to tolerate shellﬁsh and vice versa. Delayed Anaphylaxis Due to Red Meat and Association With Cetuximab Reactions Recently, a delayed reaction of 3 to 6 hours af- ter ingestion of mammalian red meat has been identiﬁed. Identiﬁcation of this phenomenon occurred after hypersensitivity reactions were reported to cetuximab, predominantly in pa- tients in Southern states. Further investiga- tions noted that

reaction of 3 to 6 hours af- ter ingestion of mammalian red meat has been identiﬁed. Identiﬁcation of this phenomenon occurred after hypersensitivity reactions were reported to cetuximab, predominantly in pa- tients in Southern states. Further investiga- tions noted that these patients had an IgE antibody to galactose-a-1,3-galactose (alpha- gal), a carbohydrate moiety in cetuximab that is also present in mammalian red meat.26 It was later noted that the distribution of cetuximab reactions and delayed red meat reactions overlapped with the geographic dis- tribution of Amblyomma americanum (the Lone Star tick). When questioned, patients who presented with delayed meat reactions and IgE antibodies to alpha-gal recalled recent tick bites. An IgE reaction to alpha-gal should be sus- pected in patients who may have been exposed to the Lone Star tick and present with repeated episodes of urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis without a known trigger. The association with red meat may not be readily apparent given the delayed nature of these reactions. Patients often report reactions in the middle of the night after consuming mammalian red meat for dinner. Implicated meats include beef, lamb, pork, venison, goat, and bison. The diagnosis is made through history and detection of elevated serum IgE antibodies to alpha-gal on a commercially available test. Skin prick testing has variable util- ity in diagnosis.27 Affected patients should

Skin prick testing has variable util- ity in diagnosis.27 Affected patients should avoid all mammalian meat.8 Wheat Wheat allergy most commonly develops in childhood and is usually outgrown before adulthood.8 Cross-reactivity between grains is 20%.14 Elimination of all grains in a patient with wheat allergy may be nutritionally harm- ful and therefore is not recommended.8 If there is concern about allergies to other grains, an oral challenge may be performed. Celiac disease is a noneIgE-mediated small- bowel immunologic reaction to gluten in geneti- cally susceptible individuals. Patients present with symptoms of malabsorption including diarrhea, bloating, weight loss, and growth fail- ure in children. Laboratory testing can reveal anemia and vitamin deﬁciencies. Testing for ce- liac disease should take into account whether a patient is consuming a gluten-free diet and the probability of disease. Testing may include small-bowel biopsy and serum antietissue transglutaminase antibody measurement (both of which should be done while the patient con- sumes a gluten-rich diet) and/or HLA-DQ2/ DQ8 testing. Treatment is gluten avoidance.

Oral Allergy Syndrome Oral allergy syndrome (also known as pollen food allergy syndrome) is caused by allergen proteins that share homology between environmental pollens and fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts. Pa- tients are usually sensitized to the environmental allergen and then experience reactions when ingesting a food that contains the closely related protein. For example, the Bet v 1 protein in birch pollen shares homology with the Mal d 1 protein in apple and the Ara h 8 protein in peanut, result- ing in clinical cross-reactivity in oral allergy syn- drome. Symptoms are usually localized to the oropharynx and consist of itching, tingling, and Cofactors in Food-Induced Anaphylaxis Some patients experience allergic reactions to food only in the presence of a cofactor. Exer- cise, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, asthma, infections, and alcohol are well- known cofactors that induce food-related 1416 Mayo Clin Proc. n October 2015;90(10):1411-1419 n http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2015.07.012 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org [PAGE 7] reactions.28 Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) is a well-identiﬁed phe- nomenon.

Several case reports of anaphy- laxis after celery ingestion and exercise have also been published.30 Other foods such as nuts and shellﬁsh can also be implicated in food- dependent exercise anaphylaxis. Identifying this association is important in advising against exercise after ingestion of these foods. setting of a questionable history and to conﬁrm the development of tolerance in a previously allergic patient. An oral challenge should only be performed in a setting that is equipped to handle severe allergic reactions. Component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) is a relatively new testing option, and its uti- lity has been studied principally in peanut allergy. Whereas traditionally used sIgE tests evaluate for IgE associated with the whole food, component testing can identify IgE for speciﬁc components of the food, differenti- ating between components that are clinically important in allergy and those that are not. Studies of component testing for Ara h 2 (a component of peanut) have reported greater diagnostic accuracy with

IgE for speciﬁc components of the food, differenti- ating between components that are clinically important in allergy and those that are not. Studies of component testing for Ara h 2 (a component of peanut) have reported greater diagnostic accuracy with this method than with evaluating IgE for whole peanut.32 The utility of CRD testing for other foods is vari- able, and increased speciﬁcity results in decreased sensitivity. Although CRD is promising, it should be studied further before it is widely used. Intradermal testing and patch testing should not be performed for diagnosis of food allergy.5 DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis of food allergy is based on a suggestive history, allergen-speciﬁc IgE (sIgE), SPT, and/or a food challenge. A positive SPT or sIgE result suggests sensitization, and therefore, a history of a reaction or a positive food challenge result is additionally needed to make a diagnosis of a clinical allergy. Skin prick testing has a high sensitivity and a negative predictive value of more than 90%,31 IgG testing is available commercially but is not recommended for diagnosis of food allergy. although speciﬁcity is lower. The accuracy of SPT depends on the commercial food extract used because such extracts are not standardized. In some instances, an SPT with fresh fruits and vegetables may be more accurate than using commercial extracts given the lability of aller-

The accuracy of SPT depends on the commercial food extract used because such extracts are not standardized. In some instances, an SPT with fresh fruits and vegetables may be more accurate than using commercial extracts given the lability of aller- genic proteins. A reaction 3 mm greater than the negative control is generally considered pos- itive, although this standard can vary among facilities. Wheal size on SPT and sIgE levels correlate with the likelihood of a reaction and in some foods the probability of outgrowing an allergy, and therefore patients can be followed up over time to evaluate for tolerance.1 For example, an sIgE for egg of 2 kU/L predicts a 95% proba- bility of reaction to egg in children younger than 2 years of age. However, for children older than 2 years of age, an sIgE of 7 kU/L has a 95% prob- ability of reaction to egg.2 Diet and Education Unfortunately, there are no Food and Drug Administrationeapproved treatment options for food allergy. Management at this time is centered on strict avoidance of foods and im- mediate management of a reaction. Patients should be prescribed a targeted allergen avoid- ance diet including relevant cross-reactive foods. It is crucial that patients and parents of children with food allergy are educated on reading food labels and are aware of the

of a reaction. Patients should be prescribed a targeted allergen avoid- ance diet including relevant cross-reactive foods. It is crucial that patients and parents of children with food allergy are educated on reading food labels and are aware of the potential for cross-contamination of foods at restaurants, parties, and other locations. Avoidance of foods that contain the labels “this product may contain trace amounts of allergen” or “manufactured on equipment with” may be prudent.8 The Food Allergy Research and Education website provides valuable and practical information for patients, including common products containing allergens and information on reading food labels. An epinephrine autoinjector should be provided to patients with food allergy, as well as a written emergency action plan for reactions. Patients An open oral food challenge is commonly used to conﬁrm tolerance to a food after SPT and/or sIgE testing is negative for allergy in the Mayo Clin Proc. n October 2015;90(10):1411-1419 n http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2015.07.012 www.mayoclinicproceedings.org 1417 [PAGE 8] should be followed up regularly by a physician to discuss accidental exposures or reactions and to evaluate for tolerance.

Food allergy can be diagnosed by blood or skin IgE testing or an oral challenge. At this time, treat- ment of a food allergy is centered on education, avoidance of allergenic foods, and management of acute reactions. A question that is occasionally raised is whether patients with food allergy can donate blood products. Although case reports have documented the transfer of a speciﬁc allergy via transfusions,33 such transmission is extremely rare. At this time, the presence of a food allergy does not automatically exclude an individual from donating blood products.

However, local gastrointestinal reactions and sys- temic reactions requiring epinephrine have been reported with OIT, and further study is needed.37 Studies on SLIT have also documented effectiveness with foods including peanut,38 hazelnut,39 and milk.40 In general, limited data suggest that OIT is more effective than SLIT in developing tolerance to an allergenic food, although SLIT has an improved safety proﬁle.41 Oral immunotherapy and SLIT hold promise as future treatment options for food allergy, but additional studies conﬁrm- ing safety and efﬁcacy should be performed before these therapies can be widely implemented. CONCLUSION A classic food allergy is an IgE-mediated reaction manifesting as any combination of respiratory, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or pulmonary symptoms. The most commonly implicated foods include cow’s milk, egg, peanut, tree nut, soy, wheat, shellﬁsh, and ﬁsh.

Lack of food labelling policy and non availability of adrenaline auto-injectors is a huge limiting factor for effective management of food allergy among children in India. The present review focuses on IgE mediated food allergy. The term ‘food allergy’ refers to ‘a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food’. These immune responses can be IgE mediated (type 1 hypersensitiv- ity), non-IgE mediated (cell mediated reactions) or a combi- nation of both [1]. Food intolerances are non-immune reactions. These may occur in response to exposure to metabolic substances (lactose intolerance), toxins (microbial contamination or scombroid fish poisoning), pharmacologically active components (caf- feine, tyramine in aged cheese triggering migraine) via unde- fined mechanisms. Non-IgE mediated food allergy is com- monly misinterpreted as food intolerance [1]. The prevalence of food allergy in Asia is perceived to be low. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of food allergy in the Indian population, particularly in children. Current studies have tended to utilise patient or parent- reported questionnaires and are likely to overestimate preva- lence [2]. The recent EuroPrevall-INCO study estimated the prevalence of food allergy among adults in southern India at 1.2 % with cow's milk accounting for 0.5% and apple 0.5%. Data on the prevalence of food allergies in children from this study is awaited

Data on the prevalence of food allergies in children from this study is awaited [3]. Similar studies have found the prevalence of food allergy in children at 4-5% in Singapore, 10.9% in Korea, 4.98% in north-east China and as high as 12.6% in Japan [4–7]. In China, food allergy prevalence has increased significantly in the 10 y period from 3.5% in 1999 to 7.75% in 2009 [8]. It is expected that with further increasing urbanisa- tion, development and affluence, the prevalence of food aller- gy in Asia, including India will increase similar to the Keywords Food allergy .

In addition, skin barrier impairment (as measured by transepidermal water loss) in the neonatal period predicts food allergy at 2 y of age [32]. This clearly illustrates that the route of sensitisation in IgE mediated food allergy is cutane- ous, while early-life ingestion of foods like peanut can be protective [33]. These risk factors provide possible avenues for food allergy prevention. observed rise in asthma prevalence, mirroring that of the west- ern world [9–12]. The estimated prevalence of food allergy amongst children in UK, Canada and US is around 6–8% [13–17]. In Australia, challenge proven IgE-mediated food allergy affects up to 10% of 1-y-old children [18]. Overall, current studies estimate a prevalence for food allergy of 5% adults and 8% children [1]. A three-fold increase in the prevalence of peanut and tree nut allergy was observed in UK and US between 1997 and 2008, whilst Australia has seen a 10-fold increase in specialist referrals for food allergy and five-fold increase in hospital referrals for food-related anaphylaxis [19].

five-fold increase in hospital referrals for food-related anaphylaxis [19]. The changing natural history and disease profile of allergic disease in children may be partly due to a complex gene- environment interaction whereby allergenic propensity may be modified or amplified across generations through epigenet- ic effects which can induce heritable changes in gene expres- sion. Epigenetics may be thought of as the ‘bridge’ between genotype and phenotype due to an event that changes the final outcome of a locus or chromosome without altering the un- derlying DNA sequence [19]. Epithelial barrier dysfunction due to filaggrin (FLG) loss- of-function mutations are associated with peanut allergy where skin exposure may be the sensitising route. Cigarette smoke and increased exposure to inhaled pollutants due to a rise in traffic and urbanisation are associated with increase in allergenic propensity [19]. Any food protein can potentially trigger an allergic reaction. ‘Major allergens’ most commonly responsible for significant reactions include milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, wheat and soya [20]. In India, chickpea (Cicerarietinum) is a common allergen as it is consumed in various forms including boiled, roasted and flour [21]. Anaphylaxis to chickpea has been reported [22]. Food allergy is more common among males in childhood. There is recent evidence of ethnic variations in skin and respi- ratory allergy and that patterns of sensitisation to

boiled, roasted and flour [21]. Anaphylaxis to chickpea has been reported [22]. Food allergy is more common among males in childhood. There is recent evidence of ethnic variations in skin and respi- ratory allergy and that patterns of sensitisation to foods differ among ethnic groups within the same geographic population, with such sensitisation being more common in non-white mi- norities in the United States. However, there is also evidence that food allergy in North America is more prevalent in white than non-white groups. But the increase in food allergies over a 10 y period (based on hospital discharge diagnosis) was three-fold higher in non-white groups [23–26]. Vitamin D insufficiency, dietary factors such as reduced consumption of omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, antiox- idants and obesity (inflammatory state) have also been asso- ciated with an increased risk of food allergy. Use of antacids reduces digestion of allergens resulting in exposure to more intact protein. Co-existent atopy (atopic dermatitis, asthma), increased hygiene and reduced exposure to infections may increase risk of food allergy [20, 27–30]. Breakdown of skin barrier integrity as in atopic dermatitis and delay in introduction of potentially allergenic food in in- fants allows for exposure of food and environmental allergens through the cutaneous route which may increase topical The gastrointestinal tract is comprised of single layer of co- lumnar epithelial cells

and delay in introduction of potentially allergenic food in in- fants allows for exposure of food and environmental allergens through the cutaneous route which may increase topical The gastrointestinal tract is comprised of single layer of co- lumnar epithelial cells and separates the internal sterile envi- ronment from the external world [20]. ‘The gastrointestinal mucosal barrier’ consists of physiological and immunological components. The immunological component consists of in- nate (neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, epithelial cells and toll like receptors) and adaptive (intra-epithelial lymphocytes, peyers patches, secretary IgA and cytokines) responses. Developmental immaturity of the gut barrier and immune system in infants and young children may have a role in the increased prevalence of allergy seen in the first few years of life [20, 34]. The mucosal immune system encounters enormous quantities of antigen and must supress immune re- activity to food proteins in order to develop tolerance [19]. The antigen presenting cells (intestinal epithelial cells and dendritic cells) and T regulatory cells (through the production of TGF-beta and IL-10) play a vital role in the development of oral tolerance [34]. The IgE mediated hypersensitivity response occurs due to a TH2 biased immune response.

Intestinal epithelial cells and gut dendritic cells process the luminal antigen and present it to [PAGE 3] non-IgE mediated), estimate the probability of allergic reac- tion to the specific food and guide targeted allergy testing [skin prick tests (SPT) or food-specific IgE]. In cases where there is diagnostic uncertainty, oral food challenge remains the gold standard [usually open but double blind placebo con- trolled food challenge (DBPCFC) is preferred] [36]. A reliable history in combination with positive SPT or specific IgE is required for diagnosis of IgE mediated food allergy. These tests in isolation without a supporting clinical history cannot be used for definitive diagnosis of food allergy [36]. A posi- tive allergy test (SPT or food-specific IgE) alone signifies sensitisation and not allergy. Increasing SPT wheal size or concentration of food-specific IgE levels correlate with in- creased likelihood of IgE mediated clinical allergy but gener- ally do not correlate well with reaction severity. There is no role for SPTor food-specific IgE levels in the diagnosis of non IgE mediated food allergy [20, 39, 40]. Recent development and introduction of component re- solved diagnostics involves measurement of specific IgE levels to individual component proteins that make up the al- lergenic food.

Recent development and introduction of component re- solved diagnostics involves measurement of specific IgE levels to individual component proteins that make up the al- lergenic food. These tests may more reliably differentiate be- tween sensitisation without clinical allergy and clinically rel- evant food allergy, effectively reducing the need for food chal- lenges. The most convincing data for these techniques is from peanut components, although more studies are needed to con- firm this [36]. Use of total serum IgE measurements, intradermal tests, patch tests and basophil activation tests are not recommended. Use of unproven tests such as serum allergen specific IgG4 measurements, hair analysis, iridology, applied kinesiology and electrodermal vega testing should be discouraged. T cells on a MHC class II complex. TH2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 which then stimulate B cells to produce spe- cific IgE to the food protein. This binds to mast cells to cause sensitisation initially. Subsequent exposure may trigger clini- cal symptoms as food protein cross links the specific IgE on the mast cells, releasing specific mediators [20].

Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS)/Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome (PFAS) Respiratory sensitisation to Bet V1 in birch pollen may lead to oral pruritus when eating raw apples amongst numerous other foods due to cross reactivity to homologous apple protein mal d 1. This represents an example of how oral tolerance is bypassed due to sensitisation via the respiratory route. Primary IgE mediated food allergy have symptoms usually in early infancy whilst OAS develops later [20, 35]. Natural History - Do Children Grow Out of Food Allergy? Allergy to cow’s milk, egg, wheat and soya typically resolves during childhood. However, there is recent evidence to sug- gest that resolution rates have slowed. In contrast, allergy to peanut, tree nuts, fish, shell fish and sesame tend to persist lifelong and rarely resolve [1, 36]. Prognosis is influenced by the disorder, for example, non-IgE mediated cow’s milk aller- gy has a better outcome than IgE mediated disease. Higher food-specific IgE levels at diagnosis also appear to indicate likely persistence and a decrease in their values over time may signal resolution, indicating future tolerance [1, 37]. Additional studies combing clinical and laboratory informa- tion may provide long term prognostic information to guide clinicians in the future [1]. Although the proportion of chil- dren that outgrow food allergy to specific foods varies be- tween studies,

[1, 37]. Additional studies combing clinical and laboratory informa- tion may provide long term prognostic information to guide clinicians in the future [1]. Although the proportion of chil- dren that outgrow food allergy to specific foods varies be- tween studies, around 50–60% of children with milk and egg allergy demonstrate tolerance by school age [1, 38]. Currently there is no cure for food allergy. Traditionally, the approach includes strict avoidance of the offending food, pa- tient and family education (including recognition of an aller- gic reaction) and provision of families with patient specific emergency medications (adrenaline auto-injectors) and man- agement plans in the event of an allergic reaction [36]. Careful attention to food label reading, care when obtaining food from restaurants, avoidance of cross-contact of allergenic foods during meal preparation (shared cutting boards, slicers, mixers) is necessary [20]. The lack of a comprehensive food labelling policy for at least the most common allergens within packaged foods and non-availability of adrenaline auto-injectors is a huge limiting factor in India. Increased awareness about food allergy among healthcare professionals, schools and the community is a pri- ority in order to provide effective management of food allergy in India. Initial evaluation requires a thorough allergy focused history. This should determine probable causal foods (raw or cooked), time course of reaction including symptoms, consistency of

This should determine probable causal foods (raw or cooked), time course of reaction including symptoms, consistency of the reaction, quantity ingested, and other factors (exercise, medications and intercurrent illness) [20]. IgE mediated food allergy are of acute onset (within 2 h of exposure) and the presenting symptoms are often skin, respiratory and gastroin- testinal, whereas non-IgE mediated food allergy has a delayed onset (usually 1 to 24 h) of symptoms. This will help to de- termine the likely immunological mechanism (IgE mediated/ [PAGE 4] Adoption of a ‘more active approach’ in the management of food allergy is an emerging concept which is based upon evolving research [36]. This includes: a) Early dietary intro- duction of potentially allergenic foods; b) Active anticipatory testing for related allergens once a specific food allergy is identified; and c) Newer strategies. There is evidence now in the literature that 70–75% of chil- dren with cow’s milk and egg allergies can tolerate them when extensively heated. This could potentially make dietary re- strictions easier and hasten the development of tolerance, al- though it remains difficult to predict which children will tol- erate baked allergens [36, 48–50].

when extensively heated. This could potentially make dietary re- strictions easier and hasten the development of tolerance, al- though it remains difficult to predict which children will tol- erate baked allergens [36, 48–50]. Early dietary introduction of potentially allergenic foods may prevent the development of food allergy. This is supported by various recent studies which have shown that early exposure to cow’s milk, egg and peanuts may be protective against the development of IgE mediated allergy to these foods [33, 36, 41–44]. Most recent systematic review and meta-analysis [includ- ing the results of interventional studies such as LEAP (Learning Early About Peanuts) and EAT (Enquiring About Tolerence) in the United Kingdom] by Lerodiakonou et al. found moderate-certainty evidence that early introduction of egg (from 4 to 6 mo) or peanut (from 4 to 11 mo) to infants was associated with reduced risk of egg and peanut allergy respectively, which will help provide more definitive guidance on early introduction of potentially allergenic foods in infants [45]. Advice around early introduction of peanut in high risk children has already been issued in the United States. Food OIT (concentrated on cow’s milk, egg and peanut) is an area of intensive research and represents an exciting and po- tentially disease modifying treatment which is expected to evolve in the future [36].

the United States. Food OIT (concentrated on cow’s milk, egg and peanut) is an area of intensive research and represents an exciting and po- tentially disease modifying treatment which is expected to evolve in the future [36]. Food OIT involves administration of small but increasing doses of allergenic food to children who are allergic to that particular food in an effort to increase their clinical tolerance [36]. It is not yet recommended for routine clinical use and should not be attempted outside spe- cialist allergy units [36]. Another emerging area of interest has been the potential role of probiotics in management of cow’s milk allergy. Supplementation of extensively hydrolysed casein formula with Lactobacillus GG has been shown to accelerate the development of tolerance in infants with cow’s milk allergy. Further prospec- tive trials are currently in progress [36, 51, 52]. In addition to testing for the suspected allergen, recent guide- lines recommend testing for co-allergens (allergen commonly found to be present in association with the suspected allergen). For example, in children with peanut allergy, testing for tree nuts and sesame is recommended as the estimated rate of co- allergy is 30–40% and 25% respectively [36, 41, 46, 47]. This anticipatory approach has the potential advantages of avoiding unnecessary restrictions in the diet of children, avoiding aller- gic reactions in the

is recommended as the estimated rate of co- allergy is 30–40% and 25% respectively [36, 41, 46, 47]. This anticipatory approach has the potential advantages of avoiding unnecessary restrictions in the diet of children, avoiding aller- gic reactions in the community and preventing development of allergy to co-allergens by facilitating early introduction [36]. There is a paucity of data on food allergy in Indian children. A reliable thorough clinical history, combined with targeted al- lergy testing (SPT or food-specific IgE) is essential for diag- nosis of IgE mediated food allergy in children. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty oral food challenge (DBPCFC) is the gold standard investigation. An active approach to the man- agement of food allergies has advantages to the families and children with food allergy including the possibility of induc- ing tolerance and significant improvement in the quality of life. Food immunotherapy is an emerging area of considerable interest and research and is expected to evolve soon. Lack of food labelling policy and non-availability of adrenaline auto- injectors is a huge limiting factor for effective management of food allergies among children in India. Newer strategies that are aimed to help develop tolerance to allergenic foods more quickly have emerged recently.
